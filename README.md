# <h1 align ="center">Personal DataSet Project</h1>
Hello there! This project is meant to explore the patterns within Google's Pay-Per-Click- or PPC- advertising data. After working in the PPC world for a couple of years now, I thought it might make a good project to see how both Google as a whole as well we different industries have grown in PPC activity and ad spend.  

**Prerequisites:**  
R  
RStudio  
Specific R libraries needed include:  
  tidyverse

This shows Google's advertising revenue in US Billion Dollars by year, from 2001-2020.
